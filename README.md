## Module 1: Moving Beyond the Arduino Ecosystem
## Learning Outcomes for Module 1: 

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Explain the concept of bare-metal programming and distinguish it from Arduino-style frameworks.
- Assess the advantages and disadvantages of bare-metal programming compared to RTOS and OS-based embedded systems.
- Describe the architecture and key components of a microcontroller, including the clock system and reset logic.
- Interpret the memory map of a microcontroller and understand the role and structure of registers.
- Explain pin multiplexing and how internal peripherals are mapped to physical pins.
- Read and interpret datasheets and reference manuals, focusing on register descriptions and configurations.
- Navigate and utilize the Special Function Register (SFR) map for configuring microcontroller features.
- Identify and use the components of an embedded toolchain, including compilers, linkers, startup files, and vector tables.
- Understand the purpose and usage of flashing tools and debuggers such as ST-Link and J-Link for programming and debugging.
